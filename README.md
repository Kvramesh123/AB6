## Abstract
Farmers are currently facing a dilemma in identifying plant pathogens. Why is this? Using image data from plant
leaves, scientists are currently exploring ways to use deep learning
to identify plant-related diseases. PlantVillage Dataset is being
utilized in this project to showcase approximately 38 categories
of plant leaves. However, for better training and evaluation,
only 10 classes with 200 images each were selected to ensure
balanced learning. The preprocessing techniques for image size
and CLAHE are the first ones. These steps help in enhancing
image quality and bringing out clearer disease features. Features
are extracted from the images using PCFAN. We used CV2
(Computer Vision 2), and EfficientNet B0 is used to pinpoint
specific illnesses. The model was trained using transfer learning
and achieved strong classification accuracy of 97.9% on the
testing dataset and 96.2% accuracy on unseen validation data.
Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score consistently
remained above 95% across all disease categories. Red Fox
Optimization is used for the precise segmenting of affected areas,
improving the focus on diseased regions and achieving segmentation accuracy above 94%. This overall approach supports early
and reliable disease identification in plants.
